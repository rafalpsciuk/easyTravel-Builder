# easyTravel-Builder

![easyTravel Logo](https://github.com/dynatrace-innovationlab/easyTravel-Builder/blob/images/easyTravel-logo.png)

This project builds self-contained deployment artefacts of the [Dynatrace easyTravel](https://community.dynatrace.com/community/display/DL/Demo+Applications+-+easyTravel) demo application for the following components:

## Application Components

| Component | Deployment Artefact
|:----------|:-------------------
| mongodb   | A pre-populated travel database (MongoDB) as `easyTravel-mongodb-db.tar.gz`.
| backend   | The easyTravel Business Backend (Java) as `backend.war`
| frontend  | The easyTravel Customer Frontend (Java) as `frontend.war`.
| loadgen   | A synthetic UEM load generator (Java) as `uemload.jar` plus dependencies in `loadgen.tar.gz`.

## How to build easyTravel?

### Option A: build.sh

The `build.sh` script builds easyTravel deployment artefacts into a directory `deploy` inside your current working directory, by default. You can override the default behavior by providing the following *environment variables* to the script:

| Environment Variable  | Defaults                    | Description
|:----------------------|:----------------------------|:-----------
| ET_SRC_URL            | http://dexya6d9gs5s.cloudfront.net/latest/dynatrace-easytravel-src.zip | A URL to an easyTravel source distribution .zip file.
| ET_DEPLOY_HOME        | ./deploy                    | A directory to contain the easyTravel deployment artefacts.
| ET_BB_DEPLOY_HOME     | ./backend                   | A directory under `${ET_DEPLOY_HOME}` to contain the easyTravel Business Backend deployment artefact (the artefact will be located in `${ET_DEPLOY_HOME}/${ET_BB_DEPLOY_HOME}`.
| ET_CF_DEPLOY_HOME     | ./frontend                  | A directory under `${ET_DEPLOY_HOME}` to contain the easyTravel Customer Frontend deployment artefact (the artefact will be located in `${ET_DEPLOY_HOME}/${ET_CF_DEPLOY_HOME}`.
| ET_LG_DEPLOY_HOME     | ./loadgen                   | A directory under `${ET_DEPLOY_HOME}` to contain the easyTravel UEM load generator deployment artefact (the artefact will be located in `${ET_DEPLOY_HOME}/${ET_LG_DEPLOY_HOME}`.

#### Example: create deployment artefacts in `./deploy`:

```
./build.sh
```

#### Example: create deployment artefacts in `./deploy` and no sub-folders:

```
ET_BB_DEPLOY_HOME=. \
ET_CF_DEPLOY_HOME=. \
ET_LG_DEPLOY_HOME=. \
./build.sh
```

#### Example: create deployment artefacts in `.` and no sub-folders:

```
ET_DEPLOY_HOME=. \
ET_BB_DEPLOY_HOME=. \
ET_CF_DEPLOY_HOME=. \
ET_LG_DEPLOY_HOME=. \
./build.sh
```

### Option B: `build-in-docker.sh`

Use `build-in-docker.sh` if you want to build easyTravel deployment artefacts in a build environment that runs in Docker, so you don't have to set up your own. Deployment artefacts can be found in a directory `deploy` inside your current working directory. You can override the default behavior by providing the following *environment variables* to the script:

| Environment Variable  | Defaults                    | Description
|:----------------------|:----------------------------|:-----------
| ET_SRC_URL            | http://dexya6d9gs5s.cloudfront.net/latest/dynatrace-easytravel-src.zip | A URL to an easyTravel source distribution.
| ET_DEPLOY_HOME        | ./deploy                    | A directory to contain the easyTravel deployment artefacts under the current working directory.
| ET_BB_DEPLOY_HOME     | ./backend                   | A directory under `${ET_DEPLOY_HOME}` to contain the easyTravel Business Backend deployment artefact (the artefact will be located in `${ET_DEPLOY_HOME}/${ET_BB_DEPLOY_HOME}`.
| ET_CF_DEPLOY_HOME     | ./frontend                  | A directory under `${ET_DEPLOY_HOME}` to contain the easyTravel Customer Frontend deployment artefact (the artefact will be located in `${ET_DEPLOY_HOME}/${ET_CF_DEPLOY_HOME}`.
| ET_LG_DEPLOY_HOME     | ./loadgen                   | A directory under `${ET_DEPLOY_HOME}` to contain the easyTravel UEM load generator deployment artefact (the artefact will be located in `${ET_DEPLOY_HOME}/${ET_LG_DEPLOY_HOME}`.

#### Example: create deployment artefacts in `./deploy`:

```
./build-in-docker.sh
```

#### Example: create deployment artefacts in `./deploy` and no sub-folders:

```
ET_BB_DEPLOY_HOME=. \
ET_CF_DEPLOY_HOME=. \
ET_LG_DEPLOY_HOME=. \
./build-in-docker.sh
```

#### Example: create deployment artefacts in `.` and no sub-folders:

```
ET_DEPLOY_HOME=. \
ET_BB_DEPLOY_HOME=. \
ET_CF_DEPLOY_HOME=. \
ET_LG_DEPLOY_HOME=. \
./build-in-docker.sh
```

## How to configure easyTravel?

Aligning with principles of [12factor apps](http://12factor.net/config), one of them which requires strict separation of configuration from code, easyTravel can be configured at startup time via the following environment variables:

| Environment Variable  | Defaults         | Description
|:----------------------|:-----------------|:-----------
| ET_BACKEND_URL        | http://localhost | The URL to easyTravel's Business Backend.
| ET_DATABASE_USER      | etAdmin          | The username of the database easyTravel's Business Backend shall connect to.
| ET_DATABASE_PASSWORD  | adminadmin       | The password of the database easyTravel's Business Backend shall connect to.
| ET_DATABASE_LOCATIONÂ  | localhost:27017  | The location of the database the easyTravel Business Backend shall connect to.
